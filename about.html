          <h3>About Soren</h3
             <p>After graduating with my Biology degree I fell into real estate having already had my foot in the door working part-time in college. Although I found it very exciting and fulfilling there's a piece of me that was left unfulfilled, the part that attracted me to study hardware and OS's as a hobbie. Now it leads me here, to the software side. Building and troubleshooting the hardware and now the doing so with software completes the circle!</p> 
             <p>Searching for a software engineer to join your team? Please reach out to me and lets talk about how I can help you succeed!</p>
